## Professional Git Workflow Guide: Pushing and Pulling from a Branch

## Check Status
git status

## Verify Branch
git branch

## Pull Before Push
### Always pull the latest changes to avoid conflicts:
git pull origin staging
git push origin staging

## 1. Stage, commit
git add .

git commit -m "Your message"

## 2. Sync with remote
git pull origin staging

## 3. Push Code
git push origin staging


To pull the latest code from a Git repository without making any local changes, including commits, you can use the following command:

git pull --rebase


If you want to reset everything to match the remote branch exactly (discarding any local changes or commits), use:

git fetch origin
git reset --hard staging  # Replace 'main' with your branch name

git reset --hard origin/master

git rebase --abort
